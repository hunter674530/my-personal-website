      <p class="paragraph">
        As an aspiring software engineer I am both software and game development
        which involves learning the mechanics of multiples coding languages as
        well as the spplicstions they are used in. I started my journey with
        python but quickly realized it was not the best suited for my ambitions.
        Because of this, I decided to focus on web development including html
        and css while dabbling in C++ and C#. After I started experimenting with
        my own basic websites I realized the wealth of knowledge I would need to
        create a full website and therefore sought out this course. So far in
        the course I have improved my knowledge of html and css as well as
        learning JavaScript which ended up being much more similiar to python
        than I had expected. I have also started attempting to create games in
        the Unity game engine, following detailed tutorials. In doing so, I see
        that the Game Engines are not as scary as they look although they are
        quite extensive. My extreme lack of C# thoroughness also is perhaps the
        most challenging obstacle however, being that I struggle to troubleshoot
        and personalize the complex code I copy in the walkthroughs. In the end,
        I know that I will continue to learn and close the knowledge gap until I
        can make full use websites and games and I hope that I can learn
        alongside other perserverent software engineers.
